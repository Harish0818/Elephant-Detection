Designed a real-time elephant detection system to mitigate human-elephant conflicts and prevent property damage. Utilized advanced image processing techniques, including CNNs, YOLO, and Faster R-CNN, for accurate detection and classification of elephants. Achieved 89% accuracy with YOLO and 92% accuracy with Faster R-CNN, though performance may vary based on environmental conditions such as lighting, terrain, and camera quality. Implemented data augmentation techniques and transfer learning with models like ResNet and EfficientNet for enhanced performance. Applied hyperparameter tuning for improved detec- tion accuracy. The solution serves as an early warning mechanism, aiming to promote safer human-wildlife coexistence.
